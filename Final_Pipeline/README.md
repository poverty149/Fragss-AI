## Viral Clip Generation of Video Game Streams

### Introduction

This folder contains all the relevant code required to process long videos and generate viral clips.

### Instructions

The code used for training the video and audio classification models can be found in video_classification_training.py and audio_classification_training.py respectively.

For the audio tagging section you have to download the pretrained weights from this [link](https://zenodo.org/records/3987831)

Download the pretrained weights for the action recognition model used while training from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rlZ-xTkTMjgWKiQFUedRnHlDgQwx6yTm/view)

### Dataset
I have provided a copy of the csv file containing the metadata of the viral and non-viral videos used for training. You can alternatively collect your own videos by using the tiktok scraper and youtube downloader files located in the virality folder.
