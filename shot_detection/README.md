## Further steps

For improving the processing speed, we can next attempt to leverage the benefits of distributed computing by using pyspark to build a faster pipeline for processing the video frames. We would have to account for the cost implications of using big data technologies in the near future.


## Research 

1. Went through most of the industry based short video/reel generators. Like Opus Clip, Quickreel, Qlip.ai etc. The large majority are using transcripts to generate the highlight clips. But provided that their focus is on content creation in general and no tool is aptly suitable for the video gaming industry
2. Majority of the developers were discussing the constraints of using python for video processing as the speeds achieved are incredibly slow. But hopefully, pyspark can help us avoid this problem altogether. Else, might have to utilise some other language for the initial video processing alone.
